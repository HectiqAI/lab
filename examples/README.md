# Examples

## ✍️ mnist-classifier
This example contains a script that trains a CNN network in [pytorch](http://pytorch.org) on the MNIST dataset. You'll also find an example of `app.py` to create your own streamlit app on Hectiq Lab and test the model.

It showcases the features:
 - initiate a run
 - use the Config 
 - track the package versions and logs
 - push metrics
 - save a model
 - load a model in an app
